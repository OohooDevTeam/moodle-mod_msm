-----------  In Atoms.xsd
->  The element <tablabel> in Atoms.xsd should be renamed to <textcaption> (or something similar).
->  The element <description> might have to be modified to achieve a fit into existing Moodle frameworks like SCORM.
-----------  In Theorem.xsd
-> <part.theorem>-attribute "counter". Right now, this is a positive integer. We might need to replace it by something like "previous sibling" or "next sibling", or we might need to both of these attributes.
-> <logic> in <proof.block>: the type attribute might be better designed with enumerations: (A implies B), (A is implied by B), or (A is equivalent to B).
-----------  In Example.xsd
-->  <example.pack> plays the role of a compositor for a collection of examples. It might be more appropriate to replace <example> as a child by a reference to the id of the desired example.
-->  <showme.pack> same comment as for <example.pack>
-->  <part.body>  it might be better to rename it to <part.example.body>
------------ In Unit.xsd
--> <nesting.unit.ref> needs a different approach; the compositor describes the actual composition. Here it would be better to describe the available choices of children; if there are competing works on the same topic, it would be nice to identify their availability here as well.
