	<caption>Uniqueness of the number 0</caption>
	<statement>
		<para>There is only one element in <latex>\RNr</latex> which is neutral with respect to addition.</para>
	</statement>
	<proof type="Proof">
		<para>The existence of at least one element <latex>0</latex> which is neutral with respect to addition is guaranteed by the appropriate axiom. If there is one such element, there could be many. So consider an arbitrary element <latex>\theta\in \RNr</latex> which satisfies <latex>a + \theta = a</latex> for all <latex>a\in \RNr</latex>. Then</para>
		<math.display>
			<latex>0 = 0 + \theta = \theta</latex>
		</math.display>
		<para>The identity on the left holds because <latex>\theta</latex> is neutral, and the identity on the right holds because <latex>0</latex> is neutral. Both identities together say that <latex>0</latex> is the only element in <latex>\RNr</latex> which is neutral with respect to addition.</para>
