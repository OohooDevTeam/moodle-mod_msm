	<para>Systematic, yet informal and intuitive use of infinite process and their limits started in the second half of the 17th century, notably with the invention of differential and integral calculus: Newton, Leibniz. The early development of mathematical analysis was driven significantly by the desire to place such intuitive use of limits on a solid foundation: Cauchy, Weierstra&szlig;, etc. Now, apart from being a vast subject in its own right, mathematical analysis has branched of into generalizations: points set topology, measure theory, operator theory, ... which carry their own names.</para>
