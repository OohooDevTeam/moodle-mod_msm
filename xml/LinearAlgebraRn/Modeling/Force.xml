	<intro>
		<para>When a force acts on an object, it does so in a certain direction and with a certain strength. Thus we can model a force by a vector. The direction in which the force acts corresponds to the direction of the vector, and the magnitude of the force corresponds to the length of the vector.</para>
	</intro>

		<para>For example, suppose a vector of length <latex>1</latex> corresponds to a force of <latex>1000N</latex>. Then the following arrows represent forces as

		<para>From experiments we learn that several forces acting simultaneously on an object can be consolidated into a single force. Moreover, the consolidated force corresponds to the vector sum of the individual forces. â€“ The picture below illustrates this. Here we have two forces, <latex>F_1</latex> and <latex>F_2</latex> acting on an object. The resulting combined force is described by the red vector <latex>F_1 + F_2</latex>.</para>
