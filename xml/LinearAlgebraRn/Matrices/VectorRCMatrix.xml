			<para>Let us comment on the need for vector notation, row matrix notation, and column matrix notation. At this point we have developed 3 ways to write an ordered string of numbers; for example</para>
			
			<table align="center" border="3" cellpadding="3" bordercolor="Maroon">
				<row>
					<cell><para><b>vector</b></para></cell>
					<cell><para><b>row matrix</b></para></cell>
					<cell><para><b>column matrix</b></para></cell>
				</row>
				
				<row>
					<cell><para>(15,4,-7)</para></cell>
					<cell><para><latex>[15\ \ 4\ \ -7]</latex></para></cell>
					<cell><para align="center"><latex>\left[\begin{array}{r} 15 \\ 4 \\ -7 \end{array}\right]</latex></para></cell>
				</row>

			<para>Isnâ€™t this a prime example of inflated symbolism? Why not just settle on one way of writing an ordered string of numbers and be done with it?</para>
			
			<para>Yes, perhaps in principle, we could manage with one way of writing an ordered string of numbers. But we would end up losing a lot! Just from an organizational point of view, the rows and columns of the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations correspond visually to the location of these coefficients within the system of equations. If abandon the option of writing a sequence of number as needed in an application, we would lose our method of solving a system of linear equations by transforming its coefficient matrix.</para>
			
			<para>But there is much more. We will soon learn how to compute with matrices in a way which extends computing with numbers, thereby creating the amazingly versatile and powerful algebraic structure of &lsquo;matrix algebra&rsquo;. Within this algebraic structure, row and column matrices behave very differently. In particular, if we want to incorporate a vector like  <latex>(15 , 4 , -7)</latex>  into this algebra of matrices, we reserve the option to write it as a row matrix or as a column matrix, depending on the specific context.</para>
			
			<para>In other words, without the option of writing a vector as a row matrix or as a column matrix as needed, we would break some valuable features of the extension of the system of real numbers <latex>\RNr</latex> provided by matrices.</para>
