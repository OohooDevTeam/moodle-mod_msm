					<caption>Examples of settings which lead to the problem of finding the distance of a point from a hyperplane.</caption>
					<para>Examples of situations which lead to the problem of finding the distance of a point from a hyperplane include:</para>
					<ul>
						<li><para>The problem of determining the altitude of an air plane&rsquo;s landing gear above the runway.</para></li>
						<li><para>The problem of determining the distance of a ship from a straight shore line.</para></li>
					</ul>
					<para>It will help you understand the scope of this problem if you find more examples yourself.</para>

			</subordinate>. Later, it will also enable us to carry out &lsquo;least squares&rsquo; approximations. Happily, there is one simple formula which solves the problem of finding the distance of a point from a hyperplane completely and in all dimensions.</para>
