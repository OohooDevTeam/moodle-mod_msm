	<caption>Infinitely many solutions - existence version</caption>
	<statement>
		<para>Suppose a system of linear equations with <latex>n</latex> variables has 
			<subordinate>
				<hot>rank</hot>
				<info><para>Recall: the rank of a system of linear equations is the number of leading <latex>1</latex>'s in the non-augmented part of its RREF-matrix</para></info>
			</subordinate>
			<latex><![CDATA[ r<n ]]></latex>. If its RREF-matrix has no leading 1 in the augmentation column, then this system has infinitely many solutions. Moreover, number values for all variables whose associated columns do not contain a leading <latex>1</latex> may be chosen freely, and each such set of choices determines unique values for the remaining variables which solve the system.</para>
