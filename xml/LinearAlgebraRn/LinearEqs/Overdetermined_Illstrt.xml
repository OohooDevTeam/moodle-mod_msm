			<para>The picture below shows the lines of solution of three linear equations in two variables.</para>
			
			<para align="center"><img src="ims/ThreeEqnsR2Overdetermined.gif" width="434" height="318"/></para>
			
			<para>Each of these 3 lines is the solution set of a linear equation in two unknowns. These three lines have no point in common. Therefore the set of simultaneous solutions of the three equations is empty.</para>

			<para>When dealing with 3 equations in 2 variables, how &lsquo;often&rsquo; does this happen? &ndash; Observe: shifting or rotating any of these solution lines a little will not qualitative change the picture  in the sense there is still no point common to all three lines.</para>
			<para>On the other hand, start from a situation where all three lines pass through a common point. It is then possible to displace two of these lines by a suitable tiny amount so that they have no point in common. (Try this!) So this situation where three lines in the plane have a point in common is a &lsquo;rare&rsquo; and special case.</para>
