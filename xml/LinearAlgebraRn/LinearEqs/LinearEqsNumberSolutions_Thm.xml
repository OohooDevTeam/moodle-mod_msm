	<statement>
		<para>Given a system of linear equations, the following apply</para>
		<part partid="NoSolutions"><para>The system has no solution exactly when the RREF of the augmented coefficient matrix has a leading <latex>1</latex> in its augmented part</para></part>
		<part partid="UniqueSolution"><para>The system has exactly one solution exactly when the RREF of the augmented coefficient matrix has a leading <latex>1</latex> in each column of its non-augmented part and no leading <latex>1</latex> in its augmented part</para></part>
		<part partid="InfSolutions"><para>The system has infinitely many solutions exactly when the RREF of the augmented coefficient matrix has all leading <latex>1</latex>&rsquo;s in the non-augmented part, and there is at least one non-augmented column without a leading <latex>1</latex>. In this case the number of free variables describing the collection of all solutions is equal to the number of variables less the number of leading <latex>1</latex>&rsquo;s.</para></part>
