		in  <latex>n</latex>  unknowns. Fortunately, there are several methods at our disposal to respond to this task. In this chapter we discuss the following:</para>
	
	<ul>
		<li><para>A <b>geometrical method</b>. It uses the fact that the solutions of a single linear equation in <latex>n</latex> unknowns form a 
			<subordinate>

				<companion>
					<subpage.ref subpageID="Illustr_Hyperplane"/>
					<para>Recall an illustration of a hyperplane</para>

			Therefore the simultaneous solutions of <latex>m</latex> such equations form the

			yields explicitly the solutions of a given system of linear equations. This method is a programmable procedure which transforms a given system of linear equations into simpler and simpler ones. In the end, one is left with a system of linear equations which is so simple that its solutions can be read off immediately.</para></li>
	</ul>
	
	<para>Later we will learn a more advanced method for solving certain kinds of systems of linear equations: Cramer’s rule is a formula which is applicable to a system of <latex>n</latex> linear equations with <latex>n</latex> unknowns termed non-degenerate. Such a system has always exactly one solution, and Cramer’s rule computes it by a formula involving determinants.</para>
