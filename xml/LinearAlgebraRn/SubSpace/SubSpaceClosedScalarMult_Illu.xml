	<title>Sub Vector Space is Closed under Scalar Multiplication - Illustration</title>
	<sub.page.body>
		<block>
			<para>The collection of vectors in a subvector space <latex>V</latex> of <latex>\RNr[n]</latex> is closed under scalar multiplication. Here are some illustrations of what this means.</para>
			
			<para>The subset below is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. So it is a subspace of <latex>\RNr[n]</latex>.</para>

				<caption>The scalar product <latex>t\cdot \Vect{x}</latex> of a vector in <latex>V</latex> by a number is again in <latex>V</latex>.</caption>

			<para>The two lines below form a set <latex>S</latex> which is closed under scalar multiplication: For any vector <latex>\Vect{x}</latex> in <latex>S</latex>, the entire line through the origin in the direction of <latex>\Vect{x}</latex> also belongs to <latex>V</latex>.</para>

			<para>The set <latex>S</latex> above is, however, not closed under vector addition. Therefore it is not a subvector space of <latex>\RNr[n]</latex>.</para>

			<para>The blue dots below form a set <latex>S</latex> which is closed under vector addition but not under scalar multiplication. To see that it is not closed under scalar multiplication, consider any vector in <latex>S</latex>: there are points on the line through <latex>\Vect{x}</latex> which do not belong to <latex>S</latex>.</para>

				<caption>The scalar multiple of <latex>\Vect{x}</latex> in <latex>S</latex> by a number is not always again in <latex>S</latex>.</caption>
			</figure>
			<para>Therefore this set <latex>S</latex> is not a subvector space.</para>
