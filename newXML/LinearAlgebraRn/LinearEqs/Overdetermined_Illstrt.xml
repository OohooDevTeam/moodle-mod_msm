            <para>
               <para.body>Each of these 3 lines is the solution set of a linear equation in two unknowns. These three lines have no point in common. Therefore the set of simultaneous solutions of the three equations is empty.</para.body>

            <para>
               <para.body>When dealing with 3 equations in 2 variables, how ‘often’ does this happen? – Observe: shifting or rotating any of these solution lines a little will not qualitative change the picture  in the sense there is still no point common to all three lines.</para.body>
            </para>
            <para>
               <para.body>On the other hand, start from a situation where all three lines pass through a common point. It is then possible to displace two of these lines by a suitable tiny amount so that they have no point in common. (Try this!) So this situation where three lines in the plane have a point in common is a ‘rare’ and special case.</para.body>
