         <para.body>When we shift an object in space, each of its points gets moved by the same distance in the same direction. As is illustrated below, a vector can describe such a shift.</para.body>

      <para>
         <para.body>A translation of an object moves each of its points in the same direction by the same distance. Therefore all of the arrows which join a point to its displaced copy represent the same vector. This vector, therefore, describes the translation.</para.body>
