               <para.body>Here an object is suspended on a rope. We model the downward force of 1000N, corresponding to the weight of the object, by a downward arrow whose length corresponds to the magnitude of the force of 1000N. Accordingly, the vector representing a downward force of 2000N would be twice as long. The vector representing a downward force of 500N half as long; etc.</para.body>
            </para>
            <para>
               <para.body>To hold the object in suspense, the downward force must be compensated by an upward force of equal magnitude. This upward force results from two forces, denoted <math>
                     <latex>F_1</latex>
                  </math> and <math>
                     <latex>F_2</latex>
                  </math>, sidewards upward in the rope. The magnitude of these forces can be computed with elementary geometric methods.</para.body>
