            <para>
               <para.body>It is very likely that you have already come in contact with the concept of a function. For example, within the context of calculus, you might have gotten used thinking of a function as a curve in a 2D-coordinate system like this one:</para.body>

            <para>
               <para.body>Here the domain <math>
                     <latex>X</latex>
                  </math> of the function is an interval of the horizontal axis, and the target <math>
                     <latex>Y</latex>
                  </math> is <math>
                     <latex>\RNr</latex>
                  </math>. The curve in the graphic consists of all points <math>
                     <latex>(x,y)</latex>
                  </math> in <math>
                     <latex>\RNr[2]</latex>
                  </math> with <math>

            <para>
               <para.body>Let us understand clearly that the curve in the graphic does not depict the transformation described by <math>
                     <latex>f</latex>
                  </math>. Rather, the curve is called the ‘graph’ of <math>
                     <latex>f</latex>
                  </math>.</para.body>
            </para>
            <para>
               <para.body>For most of our present purposes the graph is not the appropriate object to associate to a function. Therefore it is necessary to take the concept of a function in its original form and then learn how to use it to transforms space.</para.body>
